### Motivation

I wanted to get a deep understanding of how react works. This project was a way for me to understand how i can connect the front-end to the back-end effectively and watching the website turn dynamic. Im not interested much in UI/UX but this project was an good experience for me to deep dive into CSS. I didnt use any third party coded components just so i can understand react myself.
